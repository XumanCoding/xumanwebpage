        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>

          Hey there, I'm Suman, a tech aficionado with roots in Thanjavur, currently on a quest for knowledge at A.V.V.M Sri Pushpam College.

In the realm of coding, I'm a wizard conjuring up web wonders with Python, from crafting sleek webpages to taming unruly URLs. I've also ventured into the exciting world of e-commerce, sculpting digital storefronts with the power of SQL.

When I'm not immersed in lines of code, you'll find me cheering on cricket heroes, exploring fantastical anime realms, or simply losing myself in the rhythm of music.

Fueling my drive for excellence, I've proudly earned badges in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, Excel, SQL, and Prompt Engineering, each certification a testament to my dedication to mastering the craft.

Embark on this thrilling odyssey with me as we navigate the ever-expanding universe of technology, leaving our mark on the digital frontier.
